# Uncaught ReferenceError: unexist is not defined in Next.js
This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js applications caused by referencing an undefined variable.  The error is not caught during the build process and only manifests during runtime.  This can be challenging to debug, especially in larger applications.

## Problem
The `pages/about.js` file attempts to access a variable `unexist` which is not defined, resulting in an `Uncaught ReferenceError`. Next.js's server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side hydration process make this error particularly tricky to diagnose if not handled properly.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing proper error handling (try...catch block) or ensuring that all variables are properly defined before use.  This ensures the application continues running gracefully, prevents unexpected crashes, and improves the user experience.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in JavaScript applications, specifically within the Next.js framework.
